"""
Model 2 - Cash-Flow Forecast API.

Wraps simulate_cashflow() (which internally calls Model 1's live API through
model1_client.py) behind a FastAPI endpoint - same integration pattern as
your teammate's main.py for Model 1.

Run this as its OWN server, on a DIFFERENT port than Model 1's:
    python -m uvicorn api.cashflow_api:app --port 8001

Keep Model 1's server running on port 8000 at the same time in another
terminal - this API calls that one internally, same as model1_client.py
already did when we tested it directly.
